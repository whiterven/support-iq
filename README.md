# support-iq
SupportIQ is a 5-agent autonomous support operations system powered by Elasticsearch Agent Builder, Gemini 2.5 Pro via Vertex AI, and the A2A (Agent-to-Agent) protocol. It eliminates 70% of manual support triage, predicts ticket surges before they happen, and gets smarter every week through a built-in human feedback loop.
